# CVE-2020-0601 : CurveBall CVE exploitation

This ruby script can be used to spoof a legit certificate authority and generat a certificate that will be considered valid for Windows computer affected by the CurveBall vulnerability.

You need to get a certificate comming from the certificate authority you want to spoof.
Then, you can run the script with the following command :
`ruby gen-rogue-cert.rb ca.crt "/C=France/ST=Ile de France/L=Paris/O=Org" cert_rb.p12`

For the moment the script can only be used to sign executable but wait few days or make a pull request to update it ! :)
